#  translation: 您可以添加自定义 gcode 宏可访问的数据。\n每行可以定义一个变量。\n格式为“变量名称=值”。变量名称只能包含 [a-zA-Z] 字符或“_”。\n可以解析为 int 或 float 的值将可用作数值。\n用双引号括起来的值将作为字符串提供（不带引号）\n仅将值作为“真”或“假”的值将是布尔值）\n每个其他值都将按原样解析为字符串。\n这些变量将在自定义 gcode 中作为数组提供（每个挤出机一个项目），不要忘记将它们与 {current_extruder} 索引一起使用以获取当前值。如果灯丝在改变其类型的变量上有拼写错误，则解析器会将所有内容转换为字符串。

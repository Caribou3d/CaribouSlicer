#Similar to me: Prevent transitioning back and forth between one extra perimeter and one less.

Increasing this margin reduces the number of transitions, which reduces the number of extrusion starts/stops and travel time. However, large extrusion width variation can lead to under- or overextrusion problems.If expressed as percentage (for example 25%), it will be computed over nozzle diameter.
